# SMU_Project-1
Austin Housing  EDA
Jon Arnold, Greyson Moore, Thi Q

Description:
This repository contains project 1 in the SMU Data Analytics course. It uses a dataset with information on Austin, Tx home sales from 2018 to 2021. Each notebook contains individuals' work on cleaning and organizing the data. The cleaned info was then used to create visuals and prediction models to display the data. Finally, a slide deck with the group's findings was created and presented to the rest of the course.
